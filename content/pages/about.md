The only thing I love more than writing is the process of figuring out what needs to be written. Every small detail teaches something new and I value theses lessons!

I wish to write a piece of code that could make me a perfect brew that I, oh so, desperately crave! o((>Ï‰< ))o

## Credentials

I am currently in the 2nd year of my bachelors in Computer Science. 

I have made this site so that I can use my skills as well as share what I learn. My goal is to identify the audience for which I write, and explain complex concepts in a friendly and non-intimidating way.

## Writing for Action

I believe that each and every piece of writing should inspire an action that is connected to a tangible goal. I wish to work to define my boundaries and test my knowledge of every line of code.
