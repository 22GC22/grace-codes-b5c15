Python, our very own Slytherin of programming languages. We all love python to a certain degree and the language doesn't let us down either. It's simplicity is flawless and shortness of the codes garners everyone's attention towards it like "Hey, look at that!", am I right?

But what makes it so great? Lets talk about it in detail.

## 1. The three S

Python is short, sweet, and simple. The language doesn't require any fancy wording and is very to the point. It is so short that even the word "else if" is nothing but "elif". As long as you keep your indents right the language will love you.

Like in JAVA where you have to have a basic layout of this-

class A{
public static void main(String\[] args) {
System.out.print("Hello World");
}
}
Although this whole thing is important for various reasons such as multithreading we won't be talking about it right now.

Python doesn't ask you for this. You can get the same output if you say-

print("Hello World")

Can it be any shorter?

## 2. Wide Domain

Python is a general purpose programming language. It is highly impactful and doesn't need various language constructs for a domain. It is simple and the best for a beginner to code and learn in without any sort of heavy burden. You can code in a wide domain without worrying about the language constructs.

## 3. Indents

Now you must be thinking that why would I mention indents when it is simply the most annoying thing in python? However, Indents make the language extremely readable.

In most of the other languages indentation doesn't play an important role. Though you should always indent it to increase the readability but there is nothing stopping you from letting it go.

But python won't let you!

Take a look at this- \[It's a dead non-indented code]

class A{
public static void main(String\[] args) {
if(true){
// Your code
if(true){
// Some code again
}
else{
// code code
}
}
else{
// code}
}
}

I haven't written much but without indenting it is hard to tell the sub-conditions apart from the parent conditions. If you don't pay attention to the brackets you might be stuck for a long time. Now imagine if the code was a lot longer. It would be a hell of a nightmare to figure what is a part of what!

But python won't let such a code run and immediately tell you that there is an indentation error.

Your format would be something like this-

if True:
\# Some code
if True:
\# Some code again
else:
\# Code code
else:
\# Code

Isn't it a lot better?

## 4. High-level Language

It is a high-level language. That means that is is overly simplified and has easy-to-read syntax. The commands are similar to English, it is easy to write and you can access the module libraries. It is also portable because it is machine independent which is a major advantage.

## 5. Interpreted Language

Python is an interpreted language which means that we don't need to first compile a code and then run it. We can do it simply by writing the file name and extension in the command prompt.

Take a look at how JAVA works-

C:Users\*location\*\ javac filename.java
C:Users\*location\*\ java filename
You first compile it and then in the next line you run it. Python shortens the time here.

See here-

C:Users\*location\*\ filename.py

## &#xD;Conclusion

Python may not be the fastest language out there but is definitely growing at a rapid speed and is one of the most simplest and powerful language you can begin with. You do not have to deal with many things because python takes care of itself.

However, every language has it's ups and downs and you should go with what meets your requirements. But if you're just starting then go with python. It won't let you down!
